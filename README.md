# Ignition Hackathon

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind developing our note-sharing app emerged from recognizing the challenges we face as students. There would come times when the Professor don't upload their PowerPoint slides, or perhaps the lecture was too absorbing that you forgot to take notes, or maybe you just 'simply' wanted to 'skip' class. This is where our product proves valuableâ€”a note-sharing interface offering a seamless, efficient, and collaborative educational experience.

## What it does
Note-Share allows users to share and browse notes for their chosen courses.

## How we built it
Our design prototype and sitemap was envisioned by Figma. We then implemented the MERN stack to build our web application.

For the frontend, we utilized Javascript, HTML and CSS and the React library. For the backend, we used Node and Express to implement API endpoints and all necessary functionalities, with MongoDB connection to maintain data persistence.

## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to apply Express and MongoDB since this was our first time building a full stack application. Additionally, implementing the database was challenging as we wanted Users to be able to upload and view files. Dealing with states within React also took us some trials and errors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having no prior background in integrating a backend, successfully delivering a product within the stipulated deadline stands as a significant achievement for us. Each of us ventured into new territories out of our comfort zones and expanded our knowledge during this hackathon period. While our product may not have achieved the desired level of completion, we take immense pride in the journey we embarked on to bring it to life. Ultimately, it was a collaborative team effort that enabled us to meet this deadline successfully.

## What we learned
Given the hacking period, we have figured out how to build a working full stack webpage from scratch that we hope would benefit our peers.

## What's next for NoteShare
In the future, we would want to implement more functionality into NoteShare. We realised that a summarization or a highlighting tool powered by AI to help with note studying might come in handy. Additionally features such as direct upload by taking pictures would come in handy.
